# Introduction to Data Analysis Workshop

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/flatiron-school/Intro-Data-Analysis-Workshop/HEAD?labpath=codealong_blank.ipynb)

A code-along Jupyter notebook for the Introduction to Data Analysis Workshop - first run on February 16, 2022.

## Data Source:

[Austin Animal Center Intakes Data](https://data.austintexas.gov/Health-and-Community-Services/Austin-Animal-Center-Intakes/wter-evkm/)

## Workshop Files in this Repository:

`codealong_blank` is the blank version of the notebook, without pre-written code, which will be live-coded during the workshop session.

`codealong_complete` is a complete version of the notebook, although it may differ slightly from what is live-coded.

## Accessing the Code:

The easiest way to follow along with the code is by clicking here: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/flatiron-school/Intro-Data-Analysis-Workshop/HEAD?labpath=codealong_blank.ipynb)

*Please note* - it can take a few minutes for Binder to create the correct environment for the notebook. There's a non-interactive view if you scroll down while the environment loads.

If you do want to run the code on your own computer, you would want to download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) to access Python, our Python Libraries, and Jupyter notebook. You can then clone down this repository from GitHub, use the `environment.yml` file in this repository to create an Anaconda environment with all the proper packages, and run Jupyter notebook to open and access the codealong files!

## Thanks for attending!
